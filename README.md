# About Myself
Hi, my Name is Ritik Kumar Singh as stated above ðŸ‘†,tI am a native of the country's capital,New Delhi.I always had a research based attitude towards life, and have always aimed of becoming a reasearcher/scientist,which is probably the reason I joined Amrita,because of the focus on research,and a well developed enviornment for the same(as far as I've heard). I have always been curious and ask a lot of questions, this attitude helped me efficiently google out the problems faced during the tasks and glide through them.I had no prior experience in Programming until now, but these tasks very actively helped me, set my hands on the keyboard.I want to join Foss to try and learn as much as possible from my peers, and learn about new tech stuff, I am also planning to try a hand out in Competitive programming.
# About the tasks
The tasks choosen for the mere puropose of selection to the club,were quite intriguing. I personaly liked this process amd the variety of the different task. This approach help me familiarize myself with various programming languages,I am a newbie to programming,so probably the right start for me.I was home qurantined for a while due to severe cold so could'nt continue with all the tasks but I have tried my very best to do as many as possible and learn from them as much.Learning by making mistakes is self motivating and I look forward for more such tasks.
